# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL)

1) What is the average danceability and energy by artist and track? 
   SELECT track_name, artist_name, AVG(danceability) AS danceability, AVG(energy) AS energy
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    GROUP BY track_name, artist_name;

2) What artist released the longest song? 
  SELECT track_name, artist_name, duration_ms
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    ORDER BY duration_ms desc;

  SELECT artist_name
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    ORDER BY duration_ms desc LIMIT 1;

3)What's the average danceability for the 10 ?
  SELECT SUM(duration_ms)/COUNT(track_name)
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    ORDER BY popularity desc LIMIT 10;

4)Then I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity
  SELECT artist_name
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    ORDER BY popularity desc LIMIT 10

5a) What is the average danceability? ANS 0.6857
  SELECT AVG(danceability)
	FROMBIT_DB.spotify;

5b)Select all the artists that have a danceability above avg danceability*/
  SELECT artist_name
    FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
    WHERE danceability > (SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM BIT_DB. spotifydata);
	
  SELECT artist_name
    FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
    WHERE danceability > (0.6857);
